# Description
The user is able to see the first movie's details, including its **poster, title, runtime,
showtime, and available tickets** when the page loads. The number of available tickets is derived by subtracting the number of`tickets_sold` from the theater's `capacity`. On the left there is a menu button, when user clicks on it displays the rest of the movie tickets display. The buy button once clicked on reduces the number of tickets available.
